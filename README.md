# ðŸŽ„ Advent of SQL 2024 ðŸŽ„  

Welcome to my repository for the **Advent of SQL 2024** challenge! This is where I document my solutions to the daily SQL challenges that run from December 1st to December 24th. Each challenge involves fun, Christmas-themed datasets designed to sharpen SQL skills and solve real-world problems.  

## About the Challenge  
The Advent of SQL is a seasonal event for SQL enthusiasts to improve their database querying skills through practical, themed challenges. The challenges are designed for intermediate-level SQL users and above, but theyâ€™re accessible for anyone looking to improve their SQL-fu.  

## Whatâ€™s Included  
Each solution tackles:  
- Parsing and analyzing provided datasets.  
- Writing creative SQL queries to meet challenge requirements.  
- Optimizing for clarity, performance, and maintainability.  

## Challenge Format  
- A new challenge is unlocked each day leading up to Christmas.  
- The datasets and instructions are designed to work with PostgreSQL but can often be adapted to other database systems.  

## Repository Structure  
Each challenge solution includes:  
- **SQL Scripts**: The query I wrote to solve the challenge.  
- **Explanation** (if needed): Key insights or learnings.  
- **Sample Outputs**: Demonstrating the query results.

## Example Challenge  
One of the early challenges involves Santa's workshop operations, where JSON parsing, mapping values, and assigning categories are used to generate meaningful reports.  

## Why Iâ€™m Participating  
Iâ€™m excited to refine my SQL skills through this creative and festive approach. These challenges provide a structured way to learn while having fun, and they serve as an excellent opportunity to connect with the SQL community.  

## Acknowledgments
